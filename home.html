        Michael Joseph Jackson (August 29, 1958 â€“ June 25, 2009) was an American singer, songwriter, and dancer. Dubbed the
        "King of Pop", he is regarded as one of the most significant cultural figures of the 20th century. Over a four-decade
        career, his contributions to music, dance, fashion, and philanthropy, along with his publicized personal life, made him
        a global figure in popular culture. He influenced artists across many genres, and through stage and video performances,
        popularized complicated dance moves such as the moonwalk, to which he gave the name, and the robot. He is the most
        awarded music artist in history.
        
        The eighth child of the Jackson family, Jackson made his professional debut in 1964 with his elder brothers Jackie,
        Tito, Jermaine, and Marlon as a member of the Jackson 5. Jackson began his solo career in 1971 while at Motown Records,
        and became a solo star with his 1979 album Off the Wall. His music videos, including those for "Beat It", "Billie Jean",
        and "Thriller" from his 1982 album Thriller, are credited with breaking racial barriers and transforming the medium into
        an art form and promotional tool. He helped propel the success of MTV and continued to innovate with videos on the
        albums Bad (1987), Dangerous (1991), and HIStory: Past, Present and Future, Book I (1995). Thriller became the
        best-selling album of all time, while Bad was the first album to produce five Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles.
        
        From the late 1980s, Jackson became a figure of controversy and speculation due to his changing appearance,
        relationships, behavior and lifestyle. In 1993, he was accused of sexually abusing the child of a family friend. The
        lawsuit was settled out of civil court, and Jackson was not indicted due to lack of evidence. In 2005, he was tried and
        acquitted of further child sexual abuse allegations and several other charges. In 2009, while preparing for a series of
        comeback concerts, This Is It, Jackson died from an overdose of propofol administered by his personal physician, Conrad
        Murray, who was subsequently convicted of involuntary manslaughter.
        
        Jackson is one of the best-selling music artists of all time, with estimated sales of over 350 million records
        worldwide.[nb 1] He had 13 Billboard Hot 100 number-one singles, more than any other male artist in the Hot 100 era, and
        was the first artist to have a top-ten single in the Billboard Hot 100 in five different decades. His honors include 15
        Grammy Awards, six Brit Awards, a Golden Globe Award, and 39 Guinness World Records, including the "Most Successful
        Entertainer of All Time". Jackson's inductions include the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame twice, the Vocal Group Hall of
        Fame, the Songwriters Hall of Fame, the Dance Hall of Fame (the only recording artist to be inducted), the Black Music
        and Entertainment Walk of Fame and the Rhythm and Blues Music Hall of Fame. In 2016, his estate earned $825 million, the
        highest yearly amount for a celebrity ever recorded by Forbes.
